        <p>Rohit Sharma, the Indian opener, is an epitome of elegance and silken strokeplay. The star Indian 
            batsman will go down in history as one of the greatest cricketers to have represented India. Rohit 
            Sharma holds several records in international cricket that he has created during the course of his 
            illustrious career, with several milestones still awaiting him.</p>
        
        <p>Born on April 30, 1987, the current Indian all-format skipper Rohit Sharma made his international 
            debut in June 2007. Since then, he has gone on to represent the country in 45 Tests, 233 ODIs, 
            and 142 T20Is, scoring more than 15,000 international runs and 41 hundreds, including an unprecedented 
            three double-tons in the 50-over format.</p>

        <p class="highlight">On that note, here's a look at the multiple records held by Rohit Sharma in all three formats of the game.</p>

        <h1>Rohit Sharma's Records in Tests</h1>

        <p>In November 2013 at Eden Gardens, Kolkata, Rohit Sharma made his Test debut against the West Indies. He went 
            on to become the 14th Indian to hammer a hundred (177) in his very first Test innings. Rohit also holds the record of 
            registering the most runs on Test debut (by an Indian). He is second only to Shikhar Dhawan, who hammered 187 against 
            Australia in Mohali earlier that year.</p>
        
        <p>In 2019, Rohit Sharma scripted history as he became the first Indian to score 100-plus runs in each innings of a Test—176 & 127—in his debut game as an opener. He achieved the feat against the visiting South African team in Pune.</p>
        
        <p>In the next Test, Rohit Sharma struck his maiden Test double-ton (212) to become the third Indian cricketer to score back-to-back centuries in consecutive Tests.</p>
        
        <p>Rohit Sharma's home Test average of 73.33 is the best by an Indian batter who has played at least 30 innings.</p>
